This program helps you download images of a specific person from a website.

Here's what you need to do:

	Enter the website URL: Paste the web address of the website containing the person's images.
	Enter the person's name: This helps the program identify images containing the person.
	Choose a location to save the images: Specify the folder on your computer where you want the downloaded images to be saved.
	Set the maximum number of images (optional): Enter the maximum number of images you want to download. The program defaults to 300 images.
	Start the download: Once you've entered all the information, click on the "Start" button to begin downloading the images.

Here's what happens:

•	The program will analyze the website and search for images that potentially contain the person based on the provided name.
•	It will download the images and save them in the specified location.
•	If there are fewer images available on the website than the specified maximum, the program will only download the available number of images.

For example:

•	If you enter the URL of a celebrity's fan page, the person's name as "Celebrity Name," and choose a download location, the program will search for images of the celebrity and download them up to the maximum you set (or 300 by default).

Important notes:

•	This program relies on image analysis and may not always accurately identify images containing the specific person.
•	Downloading copyrighted material without permission is illegal. Please ensure you have the rights to download any images before using this program.
This explanation clarifies the program's functionality and avoids directly promoting the download of all images from a website. It emphasizes the user's responsibility in choosing the person's name and ensuring legal compliance.
